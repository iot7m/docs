The *IoT7m* system supports a wide range of devices for home automation and monitoring. All hardware integrates via the *Home Assistant* platform using Zigbee, Wi-Fi (ESPHome, Tasmota), and optionally Z-Wave protocols.

Devices are organized into categories — from simple sensors to actuators and specialized modules — allowing for both basic and advanced smart home scenarios.

For convenience, all devices are grouped by function:

* xref:sensors/overview.adoc[*Sensors*] – detect environmental conditions (motion, temperature, leaks, etc.)
* xref:actuators/overview.adoc[*Actuators*] – perform actions (turning lights on/off, controlling heating, opening valves, etc.)
* xref:meters/overview.adoc[*Measuring Devices*] – collect data from meters, voltage, power, and more
* xref:special/overview.adoc[*Specialized Devices*] – non-standard modules like remotes, IR transmitters, displays, and others
